# murmur
 
 Murmur is a digital instrument built around collective flocking behavior and granular synthesis. 
 
 Murmur is being written in Java and is built using [Processing](https://processing.org/) (which I literally cannot recommend enough). It uses the [Beads](http://www.beadsproject.net/) library to work with audio files and to mess with granular audio synthesis.
 
 # Instructions
 ## Processing
 To run murmur from within the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) (again, you should get Processing!), download the "murmur" folder and run any of the .pde files inside of it.
 ## Tips
 
 Basically, experiment! Before you do, turn the volume down in the app and *to be safe* on any speakers your computer's attached to.
 
 Two tips that I think are helpful:
 
 ### Audio
 
 You'll get the most dramatic/unique results 
 
 ### Pitch
 
 # Murmuration Engine
 
The murmuration behavior is totally stolen from Craig Reynold's 1986 [Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) algorithm, a 2D version of which is also behind the front page of my website.
